## Exercise 3.9
>What does the following program do? Is it valid? If not, why not?
```cpp
string s;
cout << s[0] << endl;
```
solution 1: This code was dereferencing and printing the first item stored in `s`. Since `s` is empty, such operation is invalid, a.k.a. **undefined behavior**. 

solution 2: 不合法。使用下标访问空字符串是非法的行为。
