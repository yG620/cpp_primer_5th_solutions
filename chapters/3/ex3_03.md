## Exercise 3.3
>Explain how whitespace characters are handled in the string input operator and in the `getline` function.

 * For code like `is >> s`, input is separated by whitespaces while reading into string `s`.
 * For code like `getline(is, s)` input is separated by newline `\n` while reading into string `s`. Other whitespaces are ignored.
 * For code like `getline(is, s, delim)`input is separated by `delim` while reading into string `s`. All whitespaces are ignored.
