## Exercise 3.12
>Which, if any, of the following vector definitions are in error? For those that are legal, explain what the definition does. For those that are not legal, explain why they are illegal.
```cpp
vector<vector<int>> ivec;         // legal(c++11), vectors.
vector<string> svec = ivec;       // illegal, different type.
vector<string> svec(10, "null");  // legal, vector have 10 strings: "null".
```
