## Exercise 3.7
>What would happen if you define the loop control variable in the previous exercise as type char? Predict the results and then change your program to use a char to see if you were right.

The point here is using reference to mutate a string. If changed to something like below, `c` would become a `char` rather than `char&`. In such case, `c` is a copy of each character of string `str`, thus the assignment `c = 'X'` won't mutate `str`. As a result, after this for range statement, nothing changes. 
```cpp
string str("a simple string");
for (char c : str) c = 'X';
```
Use this method can change all the characters in a string to
`X`.
```cpp
string str("a simple string");
for (char &c : str) c = 'X';
```
