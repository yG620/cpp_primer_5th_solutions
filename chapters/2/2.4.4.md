>A constant expression is an expression whose value cannot change and that can be evaluated at compile time. 

>Under the new standard, we can ask the compiler to verify that a variable is a constant expression by declaring the variable in a constexpr declaration. Variables declared as constexpr are implicitly const and must be initialized by constant expressions:

>Best Practices: Generally, it is a good idea to use constexpr for variables that you intend to use as constant expressions.
