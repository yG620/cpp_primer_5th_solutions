## Exercise 8.12:
>Why didn’t we use in-class initializers in PersonInfo?

Cause we need a aggregate class here. so it should have no in-class initializers.

An aggregate class gives users direct access to its members and has special
initialization syntax. A class is an aggregate if
• All of its data members are public
• It does not define any constructors
• It has no in-class initializers (§ 2.6.1, p. 73)
• It has no base classes or virtual functions, which are class-related features
that we’ll cover in Chapter 15

The in-class initializers like this:
struct Sales_data {
std::string bookNo;
unsigned units_sold = 0;
double revenue = 0.0;
};
